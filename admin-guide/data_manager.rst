Data manager
============

Import data to QWAT
-------------------------

It is generally prefered to load QWAT data trough the views and not the tables, given the complexity of object model, and the business intelligence located in the edit triggers. (e.g. node and topology handling). 

A [nice alternative technique](git@github.com:nliaudat/qwat-import-sample.git) is proposed by Nicolas Liaudat, that uses directly QGIS and expressions to load datasets. Please contribute to it if you find enhancements of issues.
